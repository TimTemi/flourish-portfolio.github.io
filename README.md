## Projects
### Credit Card Fraud Detection Model Development
[Code Repo](https://github.com/TimTemi/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Model-Development)

Developed machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of credit card transactions with a significant class imbalance issue, where fraudulent transactions constituted only **0.172%** of all transactions. Various techniques, including **RandomUnderSampler** and **SMOTE**, were employed to address this challenge. Multiple machine learning models such as RandomForest, DecisionTree, and XGBoost were evaluated, with **hyperparameters tuned** using **Bayesian Optimization** to enhance model performance. The implementation of **undersampling** and **oversampling** techniques led to a notable improvement in fraud detection accuracy, as evidenced by achieving an AUPRC score of X%, representing a Y% enhancement over the **baseline model**, while also effectively reducing false positives and false negatives in the model predictions.

### Automated Music Genre Classification
[Project Link](https://github.com/TimTemi/Automated-Music-Genre-Classification)

Built a **Python** model to automate the classification of various musical genres from audio segments. This involved analyzing extensive datasets to pinpoint relevant features for classification and then employing machine learning techniques such as **multi-variable** linear regression to enhance genre prediction accuracy. The project culminated in a detailed presentation elucidating the methods, assumptions, and implications of the classification process. Python, along with **TensorFlow and scikit-learn**, was utilized for both application development and model implementation.

### Wine Recommendation Model
[Project Link](https://github.com/TimTemi/Wine-Recommendation---Vivino)

In this **data analysis** project, I ensured the reliability of data by rectifying missing values and standardizing formats, thereby guaranteeing integrity and consistency. Through thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, I investigated **customer behavior, preferences, and market trends, extracting valuable insights.** Employing visualization tools such as seaborn and plotly. I implemented machine learning techniques, notably employing the **Nearest Neighbors algorithm** to construct a **recommendation system** based on similarity. By **fine-tuning** these models for optimal performance aligned with user preferences, and demonstrated the tangible impact of the recommendation system on enhancing customer satisfaction and driving positive business outcomes.

### Predictive Conversion Model for Bank
[Project Link](https://github.com/TimTemi/Predicting-Conversion-Model-for-Bank)

Developed **machine learning model** aimed at predicting the likelihood of deposit customers accepting personal loan offers, with the goal of boosting marketing conversion rates. This involved applying a **multi-variable linear regression model** to a vast and intricate dataset, which underwent stages of data collection, cleaning, exploration, and visualization. Through comprehensive analyses of customer demographics, encompassing factors such as age, income, and other pertinent variables, I gained insights into their influence on loan acceptance. Various machine learning algorithms, including **Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines**, were implemented and fine-tuned to optimize performance, with **GridSearchCV** utilized for **hyperparameter tuning**.
